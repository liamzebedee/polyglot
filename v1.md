Automatically compiles, runs, arbitrates

polyglot
	if first arg is a command (begins with -)
		do command
	else
		`runPolyglotContainer` for each arg


runPolyglotContainer
	build dockerfile
	mount current directory as volume
	startup things:
	runPolyglotAgent

runPolyglotAgent
	get language of program format
	
	build program $language
	connect to polyglot-manager
	serve the program exports schema $language
	generate the program imports schema $language
	run the program

	onExit:
	close docker polyglot-agent process


polyglot-manager
	PORT = 42042
	clients = [A..Z]
	bind(PORT, receiveMessage) 

	receiveRpc:
	route from A to B

	receiveSchemaUpdate:
	distribute to A..Z


Dockerfile
	FROM super lightweight linux version
	install Go, npm, python, yarn
	in the startup, run the polyglot-agent
	mount current directory as the volume







What to do about compilation errors?
	Stream them through polyglot? No.
	How do you receive them normally? Just through stdout/stderr
	What about the webpack style? Not too bad I think.
What about when you're testing code?
	Test through iteration? Yeah sure why not. 
	What if we need to restart code? Just kill the polyglot process
	Anywhere the polyglot process starts it automatically connects and rigs the program
